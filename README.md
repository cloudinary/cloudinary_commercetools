## Cloudinary commercetools demo app repo

This source code is the basis for the [Cloudinary demo app](https://cloudinary-commercetools-demo.netlify.app), a frontend implementation of the Cloudinary commercetools extension. It includes ready-made React components that you can use to display assets on your website or app.

For a full description of the Cloudinary commercetools extension including setup and installation instructions, an operational overview, and a developers guide, see Cloudinaryâ€™s [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/commercetools_integration#the_cloudinary_demo_app).

To find out how to configure Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure to host the serverless microservice that integrates Cloudinary assets in your commercetools instance, see the [cloudinary_commercetools_mach](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_commercetools_mach/tree/main) repository on GitHub.
